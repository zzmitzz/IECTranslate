# WebRTC Audio Streaming Implementation

This document describes the enhanced WebRTC implementation that now supports audio streaming with processing capabilities.

## Overview

The WebRTC handler has been enhanced to properly handle audio streams, including:
- Audio track detection and management
- Audio processing pipeline
- Recording capabilities
- Statistics tracking
- Custom audio processor support

## Key Components

### 1. WebRTCHandler (`app/routes/rtc/web_rtc.py`)
The main WebRTC handler that manages peer connections and audio streams.

**Key Methods:**
- `create_peer_connection()` - Creates and configures peer connections with audio track handling
- `handle_audio_track()` - Processes incoming audio tracks
- `start_audio_recording()` / `stop_audio_recording()` - Audio recording management
- `get_audio_statistics()` - Retrieve audio stream statistics
- `register_custom_audio_processor()` - Add custom audio processing logic

### 2. AudioStreamHandler (`app/routes/rtc/audio_handler.py`)
Manages audio stream processing, recording, and statistics.

**Features:**
- Audio track processing pipeline
- Media recording capabilities
- Audio statistics tracking
- Extensible processor system

### 3. Audio Processors
Base classes for implementing custom audio processing:

- **DefaultAudioProcessor** - Pass-through audio processing
- **AudioTranscoder** - Audio format conversion
- **AudioFilter** - Audio filtering and enhancement

## Usage Examples

### Basic Audio Streaming

```python
from app.routes.rtc.web_rtc import WebRTCHandler

# Initialize handler
webrtc_handler = WebRTCHandler()

# Create peer connection (audio track handling is automatic)
pc = await webrtc_handler.create_peer_connection("room_1", "peer_1")

# Audio tracks are automatically detected and processed
```

### Audio Recording

```python
# Start recording audio from a peer
await webrtc_handler.start_audio_recording("peer_1", "recording.wav")

# Stop recording
await webrtc_handler.stop_audio_recording("peer_1")
```

### Custom Audio Processing

```python
from app.routes.rtc.audio_handler import AudioProcessor

class NoiseReductionProcessor(AudioProcessor):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("noise_reduction")
    
    async def process(self, peer_id: str, track):
        # Implement noise reduction logic
        # This could include:
        # - FFT analysis
        # - Spectral subtraction
        # - Wiener filtering
        return processed_track

# Register custom processor
webrtc_handler.register_custom_audio_processor("noise_reduction", 
                                             NoiseReductionProcessor().process)
```

### Audio Statistics

```python
# Get statistics for a specific peer
stats = webrtc_handler.get_audio_statistics("peer_1")

# Get statistics for all peers
all_stats = webrtc_handler.get_all_audio_statistics()
```

## Audio Processing Pipeline

1. **Track Detection**: WebRTC automatically detects incoming audio tracks
2. **Processing**: Audio tracks are processed through the configured processor pipeline
3. **Statistics**: Audio statistics are tracked and updated
4. **Recording**: Optional audio recording can be enabled per peer
5. **Cleanup**: Resources are properly managed and cleaned up

## Supported Audio Features

- ✅ Real-time audio streaming
- ✅ Audio track detection and management
- ✅ Audio recording (WAV format)
- ✅ Audio statistics tracking
- ✅ Custom audio processing
- ✅ Audio transcoding support
- ✅ Audio filtering capabilities
- ✅ Resource cleanup and management

## Dependencies

The following packages are required for audio functionality:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key audio dependencies:
- `aiortc` - WebRTC implementation
- `pyaudio` - Audio I/O operations
- `numpy` - Audio data processing
- `scipy` - Advanced audio processing

## Configuration

### Audio Recording Settings
Audio recordings are saved in WAV format by default. You can modify the recording format and quality in the `AudioStreamHandler` class.

### Audio Processing Settings
Default audio processors are automatically initialized. Custom processors can be registered at runtime.

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:
- Connection validation
- Resource cleanup on errors
- Graceful degradation for unsupported audio formats
- Logging for debugging and monitoring

## Performance Considerations

- Audio processing is asynchronous to prevent blocking
- Resources are properly managed to prevent memory leaks
- Statistics are updated efficiently without impacting audio quality
- Recording can be enabled/disabled per peer as needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Audio not detected**: Check that the peer is sending audio tracks
2. **Recording fails**: Ensure write permissions for the output directory
3. **High CPU usage**: Consider using lighter audio processors for real-time applications

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to see detailed audio processing information:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('app.routes.rtc').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Real-time audio transcription
- Advanced audio effects and filters
- Multi-channel audio support
- Audio quality metrics
- Adaptive bitrate streaming
- WebRTC data channel integration for metadata
